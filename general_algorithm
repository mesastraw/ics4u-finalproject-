Prompts the user to either login, signup or quit
- Quit closes the program

When signup is chosen:
- User is prompted to provide a nonexistent username and password that is saved for future logins
- When requirements are met, user gets sent back to the 1st step and can then login with the new information

When login is chosen: 
- User is prompted to provide an existing username and password 
- If failed user is reprompted or redirected to signup
- If successful user is directed to the home screen

Give the user the option to create a new circuit, continue an existing circuit or quit
- Quit closes the program
- If continue is clicked:
	- Display an error message if no projects exist
	- Otherwise, display all current projects by their name for the user to choose
		- Clicking will send user to circuit building screen
- If new project is clicked, user is redirected to the circuit screen as long as the user does not exceed 7 current projects 

User is given an empty circuit diagram (5V Battery and 2 wires in parallel):
- A grid system will be used to place all blue dots at set positons and to place components in the project
	- Each blue dot will have its position in the name for easy placement of components
- Users can place components using the add dropdown (battery, wire, led, resistor) on the plane and attach other components together.
- Component will be placed after clicking on two blue dots shown on the diagram perpendicular to each other (these will appear after component is selected)
- Once the circuit hits the requirements (closed, has a power source, etc.. ) a display will pop up with the voltage, current, resistance and power in the circuit. 

Clicking on a Component: 
- User is shown a menu where they can change the components characteristics (specific to that component) 
- Most components can change name, colour, and resistance. 
- Ex. Changing the resistance of a potentiometer.
	- Changing attributes may affect the properties of the circuit

Deleting a component:
- In the component menu, the users are able to delete the component from their circuit, doing so deletes the component and leaves the circuit open where the component originally was found. 


Finishing the Circuit (button):
Checks to see if the circuit is not finished (not all components are connected)
If they are not all connected, add wires in the positions needed to connect all components

Quitting the Program
- Once the circuit is done, users can press the finish button and save the circuit to be able to view it upon the next login.
- Returns user to the projects screen  
- The circuit cannot be saved if it is not finished
  - Reprompts user to finish the circuit
