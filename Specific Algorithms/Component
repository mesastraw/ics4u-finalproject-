Enum Type:
  -RESISTOR
  -POWERSOURCE
  -WIRE
  -MODULE
  -SWITCH

Circuit is composed of abstract Component class
	Initialize attributes
    -type as a Type Enum
    -position as a Vector
    -voltage as a double
    -current as a double
    -resistance as a double
    -power as a double
    -name as a String
    -direction as a String

	public void displayPopup()
    -Create a popup window and create an input field for every attribute that can change (this method changes the number of fields depending on the subclass)
      -Example: resistance and colour
      -This window will also be equipped with a delete button to call deleteComponent and a save button to save the new configuration of the component
    -Calculate the voltage, current and resistance at this Component by looping through the components and looking at all values up to this
